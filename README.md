FDWKit
======
The easiest way to access the FeedWrangler API on iOS or OSX. The only dependency is `AFNetworking`, which you shouldn be using anyway. Just clone and import, and you're ready to go. No further configuration required.

Installation via cocoapods will be available as soon as the project reaches 0.1.0.
