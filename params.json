No further configuration required.\r\n\r\nWhile the project doen't yet have 100% coverage of the FeedWrangler API, that is the ultimate goal. Feel free to contribute and help smooth out the rough patches, and definitely open up an issue if you use FDWKit in one of your apps so we can get a list going.\r\n\r\nCheck out the documentation at <http://segiddins.github.io/FDWKit/Documentation>.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
